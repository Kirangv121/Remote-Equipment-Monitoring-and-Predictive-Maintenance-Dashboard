## 🔥 Key Features
### 🏗 *Dashboard*
- Centralized view of all crane operations.
- Live status updates on crane health, performance, and maintenance alerts.
- Interactive UI for quick decision-making.

### 🚨 *Alerts & Notifications*
- Real-time alerts for equipment failures, excessive load, overheating, and abnormal vibrations.
- Customizable notifications via *email, SMS, or in-app alerts*.

### 🛠 *Predictive Maintenance*
- AI-powered *Autoencoder Model* for detecting potential failures before they occur.
- Data collected from *load, vibration, temperature, sound, power, and fuel sensors*.
- Reduces unplanned downtime and increases the lifespan of crane components.

### 💰 *Cost & Fuel Management*
- Tracks fuel consumption and cost analytics.
- Predicts fuel usage trends to optimize operational efficiency.
- Integration with *BharatPe* for easy cost management and invoicing.

### 🚑 *Incident Management*
- Logs and categorizes past incidents.
- Provides detailed root cause analysis.
- Ensures compliance with safety regulations.

### 🗺 *3D Map View*
- *Interactive 3D visualization* of crane locations and operations.
- Geofencing to detect unauthorized movement or risky conditions.

### 👷 *Operators Management*
- Role-based access control for different user levels (Admin, Operator, Supervisor).
- Tracks operator activities and crane usage statistics.
